/**
 * One ways we can create an array is to use an array litereal. An array litereal creates a array by wrapping items in square brackets [].
 * Arrays can store any data type and we can have an array that holds all the same data types or an array hat holds different data types.
 * The array is represented by the square brackets [] and the content inside.
 * Each content item inside an array is called an element.
 * We can have as may elements we want inside the array and they can be of a different data type.
 * We can also save an array to a variable
