// Each element in an array has a numbered position know as its index. We can access them using their index.
// Arrays in JavaScipt are zero-indexed, meaning the postions start counting from 0 rather than 1.
// You can also access individual characters un a string using braclet notation and the index. For instance, you can write:

const hello = "Hello World";
console.log(hello[6]);

const famousSayings = [
  "Fortune favors the brave.",
  "A joke is a very serious thing.",
  "Where there is love there is life.",
];
const listItem = famousSayings[0];
console.log(listItem);
console.log(famousSayings[2]);
console.log(famousSayings[3]);
