// Let's first appreciate the for loops creating first a cumbersome programm whitout a for loop.

let vacationSpots = ["New York", "Israel", "England"];
console.log(vacationSpots[0]);
console.log(vacationSpots[1]);
console.log(vacationSpots[2]);

// Imagine that the vacation list had 100 places on it. In the next lesson we will learn how make this in a more efficient way with for loops.
