/**
 * Objects are the basic sructure tha permeates nearly every aspect of JavaScript.
 * Many components of the language are actually objects under the hood, and even the parts that aren't - like strings or number - can still act like objects in some instances.
 * There are only seven fundamentals data type in JavaScript, and six of those are te primitive data types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined and symbol. With the seventh type, objects, we open our code to more complex possibilities. We can use JavaScript objects to model real-world things, like a basktball, or we can use objects to build the data structures that make the web possible.
 * At their core, JavaScript objects are containers storing related data and functionality, but that deceptively simple task is extremely powerful in practice. You've been using the power of objects all along, but now it's time to understand the mechanics of objects and start making your own!
