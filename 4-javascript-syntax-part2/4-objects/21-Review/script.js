/**
 * The object that a method belongs to is called the calling object.
 * The this keyword refers the calling object and can be used to accss properties of the calling object.
 * Methods do not automatically have access to other internal properties of the calling object.
 * The value of this depends on where the this is being accessed from.
 * We cannot use arrow functions as methods if we want to access other internal properties.
 * JavaScript objects do not have buil-in privacy, rather there are conventions to follow to notify other developers about the intent of the code.
 * The usage of an uderscore before a property name means that the original developer did not intent for that property to be directly changed.
 * Setters and getters methods allow for more detailed ways of accessing and assigning properties.
 * Factory functions allows us to create object instances quickly and repeatedly.
 * There are different ways to use object destructuring: one ways is the property value shorthand and another is destructure assignement.
 * As with any concept, it is a good skill to learn how to use the documentation with objects!
 * You're ready to start leveraging more elegant code for creating and accessing objects in your code!
