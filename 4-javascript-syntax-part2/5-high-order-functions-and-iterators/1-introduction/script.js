/**
 * With programming, we're faced with needing to be more explicit with our directions to the computer. Here's how we might tell the computer to "count to three":

for (let i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

/**
 * In programming, we can accomplish "abstraction" by writing functions. In addition to allowing us to reuse our code, funcions help to make clear, readable programs. If you encoutered countToThree() in a program, you might be able to quickly guess what the funtion did without having to stop and read the function's body.
 * Another way to add a level of abstraction to our programming is Higher-order function meaning, a function that accept other functions as arguments and/or  return functions as output. This enables us to build abstractions on other abstractions.
 * In summary, using more abstraction in our code allows us to write more modular code which is easier to read and debug
