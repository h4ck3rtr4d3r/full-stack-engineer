/**
By thinking about functions as data and learning about higher-order functions, you've taken important steps in being able to wrtie clean, modular code and take advantage of JavaScript's flexibility.
Let's review  whatwe learned in this lesson:

- Abstraction allows us to write complicated code in a way that's easy to reuse, debug and understand for human readers.
- We can work with the same way we would any other type of day including reassingning them to new variables.
- JavaScript function are first-class objects, so they have properties and methods like any object
- Functions can be passed into other functions as parameters
- A higher-order funtions is a function that eighter accepts functions as parameters, return a function, or both.
